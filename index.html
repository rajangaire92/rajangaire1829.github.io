     <div class="img1"> <img src="mb.jpg" alt=""><il1> The most Joyfull and wonderful women in my life. The one I adore the most is the love of life. When I see her face all the fear gets burst out of my head and my heart gets numb. The one I love the most, care the most and respect the most is the love of my life. She's like a angel to me who was sent to me as a gift from the god. She's so sweet like a ferrero rocher, she's so unique like a mermaid in a sea, she's so beautiful like a glacier on a mountain, she's so stupid like a...ahhha no she's not stupid, she's just crazy... for me offcourse hahaha. I can't explain so true, loving and magical she is. She's the magician of my life who just turned my life upside down... but in a presperous way. Yeah! she is the love of my life, daughter-in-law of my parents and mom of my future childrens. And I can proudly say My Love/Muna I Love You to the infinity and way beyond.  &hearts;  </il1>  </div>
